    <h1>There is so much to learn</h1>
    <p>Being an Applied Informatics Graduate and a Computational Sciences Dropout with some time on my hands, I might as well learn how a 
    damn computer works. I have found <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/bootup.html">ESRs work on the 
      Basics</a> quite enlightning. 
      I have many wonderfull projects on my mind and would love to get them through. Don't we all have personal projects on our 
      minds? Dreams, phantasies.. I know I had. There was a time when I caught myself stranded. It was a beautiful winter night in the garden of
    an old palace. I was there with an old friend. We laughed, we walked around, talked and even did some spontaneus gymnastics and cartwheels 
    on that friendly meadow... it feels like a dream today. It feels as yesterday and still... at the same time as something that happened long 
    ago, in a mythical, ethernal kind of time. Something that is hard to describe in words. It feels like an unborn child that memory. It brings
    me a little bit of sadness, a little bit of guilt, mixed with shame and nostalgia. I wish I have had done something better, I do not know.
    She asked me what my dreams were. I then was struck by the realisation that I have not even dared to think about it in the last five years
    or so. I built this shell around those deep hopes and aspirations of mine that were so personal, and so prone to being torn by the harsh
    world. I forgot to dream. That was my biggest misstake. I am now stranded in a place where barely somebody comes. Mentally that is. 
    I have so few intersection points with the world around me and feel as a stranger wherever I might be among most of the people. I 
    am in the purgatory. That place that Jesus spoke of, that "you shall not be let free, untill you paid tha last penny". 
    It is not a fun place to be in, but I am still calm. Even calmer than ever before, for I know that God exists. That I can get myself
    cleaned up and stand before Him and ask for His forgiveness. Then all my sins will be washed up and I shall rejoice in His holy mercy.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, this was supposed to be a post on tech but I kind of got carried away down the memory lane over there. It is such a beautiful
    night in my attic. I hear the rain drizzling on the roof. I cannot help but get into a meditative state and process things that have 
    happened in the past 10 years. Trying to make some sense of it all. The people I met, the books I read, the places I've been to...
    It feels quite in vain everything. It feels as if I have gathered quite a baggage of experiences and skills and am now at a point
    where Ii have got to make an inventory, take a good look at what lies ahead. Decide a Path I am to walk on and then accordingly,
    drop a lot of this baggage and only keep that, which will be of use to me on my Path.
    It is a strange world we live in. We are looking at other people for answers that only we can answer for ourselves. This is a huge
    misstake I believe. Is something that keeps us in one place, running around our tails. 
      All I have left to say for now is: Don't just stand there, hangign around, begging for the approval of some peers or waiting
      for somone or something to show you the way. God gave you a mind. Use it! 
      It might be that some people have none, but I strongly believe otherwise. I think most of us don't use our minds out of sheer
      laziness. Get up and do something worthwile with your life. Don't worry too much about trivial stuff such as money or bread. God
      feeds the birds of the sky and dresses the lilies of the field. He will see that you and I will do well. Just a little bit of 
      faith will help you move mountains.

    <h1>Project Euler</h1>
    <p>Leonhard Euler was a great mathematician. His introductory book into algebra could be very easily used today by young and old alike to learn more about the building blocks of mathematics,
      that is, the building blocks of our modern world.</p>
    <p>To honor the man, somebody tought of naming a mathematical puzzle-solving game by him. So we have Project Euler.</p>
    <p>Project Euler is a great idea. I encourage everybody to take a look at these fun mind puzzles and have fun solving them. <br> more on https://projecteuler.net/ </p>
